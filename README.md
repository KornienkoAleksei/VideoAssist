 When you're filming B-roll while on vacation, it's hard to remember what footage you've filmed. When you edit your clip on cold long evenings, you often come across a situation where it is difficult to connect two footage to each other. To avoid this, you can use a notepad with a pen during shooting or this mobile application, which will allow you to manage the shot footages for the perfect cut.
